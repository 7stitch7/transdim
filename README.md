# *transdim*

**Trans**portation **d**ata **im**putation (**transdim**) covers the following topics:

 - ***Missing data imputation***

	- *Random missing*: each sensor lost their observations at completely random. (*simple task*)

	- *Fiber missing*: each sensor lost their observations during several days. (*difficult task*)

 - ***Rolling traffic prediction*** (short-term)

	- Forecasting *without missing values*. (*simple task*)

	- Forecasting *with incomplete observations*. (*difficult task*)

# Overview

   >With the development and application of intelligent transportation systems, large quantities of urban traffic data are collected on a continuous basis from various sources, such as loop detectors, cameras, and floating vehicles. These data sets capture the underlying states and dynamics of transportation networks and the whole system and become beneficial to many traffic operation and management applications, including routing, signal control, travel time prediction, and so on. However, the missing data problem is inevitable when collecting traffic data from intelligent transportation systems.

In the both two panels, red rectangles represent fiber missing (i.e., speed observations are lost in a whole day).*
